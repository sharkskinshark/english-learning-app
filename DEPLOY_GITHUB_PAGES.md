## Common Questions

### Q: How do I add a custom domain?
**A:** GitHub Pages supports custom domains. See GitHub docs for `CNAME` setup.

### Q: Will people see my source code?
**A:** Yes, GitHub is public by default. This is fine for educational apps! If you want privacy, use a private repository (but GitHub Pages doesn't work with private repos on free plan).

### Q: Can I use a different branch?
**A:** Yes! GitHub Pages can deploy from `main`, `develop`, or `/docs` folder.

### Q: How often does it update?
**A:** Usually within 1-2 minutes of pushing to GitHub.

### Q: Is HTTPS automatic?
**A:** Yes! GitHub Pages provides free HTTPS automatically. ✅

### Q: Can I use Zeabur later?
**A:** Yes! You can always migrate. GitHub is great for starting out.
