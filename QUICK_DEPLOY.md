- [x] Netlify account (free at netlify.com)
- [x] Your app code (you have it! ‚úÖ)
- [x] 15 minutes of time

---

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

### 1a. Go to GitHub
- Visit https://github.com
- Sign in (or create free account)

- Click "Create repository"

### 1c. Clone & Push Code
```bash
# Open command prompt in your app folder
# Then run these commands:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - English Learning App v1.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/english-learning-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

---

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)

### 2a. Connect Netlify to GitHub
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub"
4. Click "Authorize Netlify"
5. Select your `english-learning-app` repository
6. Click "Deploy site"

**That's it!** Your app is now live! üéâ

Netlify will give you a URL like: `https://zealous-newton-abc123.netlify.app`

### 2b. Add Security Headers (5 minutes)

Create a file called `netlify.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self'"
    Permissions-Policy = "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()"
    Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.json"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
```

Save and commit:
```bash
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Add security headers"
git push
```

Netlify automatically redeploys when you push. Done! ‚úÖ

## Step 3: Verify It's Working (5 minutes)

### Check 1: Visit Your App
- Click the Netlify link provided
- Verify app loads correctly
- Test a few features (spelling, meaning, phonics)

### Check 2: Verify HTTPS
- URL should start with `https://` (not `http://`)
- Click the lock icon in browser address bar
- Should show "Secure"

### Check 3: Check Security Headers
```bash
# In command prompt, run:
curl -I https://YOUR_NETLIFY_URL
```

Should show these headers:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

### Check 4: Test on Mobile
- Open URL on your phone
- Verify layout adjusts properly
- Test touch controls

---

## Optional: Use Your Own Domain

If you have a custom domain (like `www.yourname.edu`):

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain management"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow Netlify's DNS setup instructions
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to propagate
5. HTTPS automatically provisioned! ‚úÖ

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "JavaScript errors in console"
**Fix:** Check browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab. Report any errors.

### Issue: "App won't load"
**Fix:** 
- Check Netlify deployment logs (click "Deploys")
- Verify vocab.json is in repository
- Check all file names match exactly (case-sensitive on Linux)

### Issue: "Progress not saving"
**Fix:** 
- Check if browser allows localStorage
- Try incognito/private mode
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: "Speech not working"
**Fix:**
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari all have different voice availability
- Some voices may not be available on some devices
- App should still work without speech (graceful fallback)
