## Before You Publish

### Do This ✅
1. Test on your target devices (phones, tablets, desktops)
2. Deploy to a platform like Netlify or Vercel
3. Enable HTTPS (most platforms do this automatically)
4. Use provided security headers (see DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md)
5. Test with Security Header tools after deployment

### Don't Do This ❌
1. Publish Python scripts (`validate_vocab.py`, `check_alignment.py`)
2. Upload without HTTPS
3. Skip security headers
4. Add external tracking without user consent
5. Store personal user data

---

## Deployment Platforms (Choose One)

### ⭐ Easiest: Netlify
- Free tier perfect for educational apps
- Automatic HTTPS
- Deploy from GitHub with one click
- Security headers easy to add
- → Visit https://app.netlify.com

### Also Good: Vercel
- Similar to Netlify
- Good performance
- → Visit https://vercel.com

### Budget Option: GitHub Pages
- Free, but limited header control
- → Settings > Pages > Enable HTTPS

### Professional: AWS/Nginx
- Full control, more complex
- Recommended for organizations

---

## Verification After Deployment

Run these tests after publishing:

```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Check HTTPS certificate
echo | openssl s_client -servername yourdomain.com -connect yourdomain.com:443

# Security score
# Visit: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
# Check: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
```

Expected results:
- All security headers present
- HTTPS enabled (not HTTP)
- Observatory score > 90
- SSL Labs grade A or A+

## Common Questions

### Q: Is this app safe for children?
**A:** Yes. It has:
- No external tracking or ads
- No social features or chat
- No personal data collection
- Controlled educational vocabulary
- No monetization

### Q: Will my data be stored on servers?
**A:** No. All data stays on the user's device in browser storage (`localStorage`). Nothing sent to servers.

### Q: What if someone hacks the website?
**A:** The worst-case impact is very limited:
- Can't access passwords (no passwords exist)
- Can't access personal data (none collected)
- Only learning progress affected
- Users can clear browser data to reset

### Q: Do I need a database?
**A:** No. The app works entirely in the browser. `vocab.json` is the only data file needed.

### Q: Can users upload files?
**A:** Not in the current design. The app doesn't support file uploads (security best practice).

### Q: Is it GDPR compliant?
**A:** Yes.
- No personal data collected
- No tracking/analytics
- No cookies (except essential browser storage)
- No cross-site requests
- Fully compliant with privacy regulations
