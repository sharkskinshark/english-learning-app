## My Recommendation for Your App

**GitHub Pages** ‚úÖ 

Why?
- Your app is 100% static (no backend needed)
- Simplest setup (5 minutes vs 10 minutes)
- Global users? GitHub CDN covers worldwide
- No backend = no Zeabur advantage
- Can always migrate to Zeabur later if needed

**But if you specifically target Asian users**, consider Zeabur.

---

## Can You Switch Later?

**Yes!** It's easy:
1. Code stays the same
2. Just deploy to different platform
3. Keep GitHub repository
4. Update URL you share
5. Done!

GitHub Pages is great for starting. Zeabur is great for growing.

---

## Final Answer

### For Your Current App:
**üèÜ GitHub Pages** (faster, simpler, free)

### If You Need Backend Later:
**‚Üí Migrate to Zeabur** (or AWS, Netlify, etc.)

---

**Bottom Line:** Deploy to GitHub Pages now (5 min), learn how it works, then consider Zeabur if you add backend features. Zero risk!
